The Tweeter plugin is built using a combination of technologies and external services to provide a seamless experience for users. It consists of the following components:

1. **User Interface (UI)** : The UI component is responsible for displaying the plugin interface within Figma. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The UI allows users to interact with the plugin's features and options.

2. **JavaScript (JS) Conversion**: The plugin's codebase is written in TypeScript (TS) and is converted to JavaScript (JS) for compatibility with the Figma plugin environment. This conversion ensures that the plugin can run within the Figma ecosystem.

3. **External APIs** :
- Picsum API: Used to generate random profile pictures for the created frames.
- Quotable API: Used to fetch random names and tweet messages for the created frames.


4. **Figma API Integration** : The plugin leverages the Figma API to interact with the Figma design editor and perform operations such as creating frames, adding images and text nodes, and manipulating the layout of the frames.
